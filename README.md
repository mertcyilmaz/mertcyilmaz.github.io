# EnerGIS

**EnerGIS** is a simple web mapping tool designed to help users assess the potential for renewable energy transitions, with a focus on the installation of PV panels on building rooftops. This repository hosts the work-in-progress files for the tool, and provides features that allow users to explore and analyse site-specific solar energy opportunities.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface**: Easily interact with maps, data layers, and outputs.
- **Energy Modelling**: Calculate potential solar energy output, along with estimated figures in savings, return-on-investment (ROI), and CO2 reduction, based on building geometries and other parameters (cost and amount of PV panel).
- **Import Dataset**: Import your own GeoJSON (building footprint) file for calculation.
- **Pop-up Information**: Access relevant information on solar energy (e.g., regulations and technical details on PV panels like installment and batteries).
- **

## Next Steps

These are the upcoming features and improvements planned for EnerGIS:

- [ ] **Replace Building Footprints**: Integrate real sample data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to replace current building footprints.
- [ ] **Colour Buildings**: Add information on building use and visualise with a legend to explain different types of buildings.
- [ ] **Pop-up Information**: Include detailed pop-ups on buildings, featuring charts and illustrations related to energy transition.
- [ ] **Export Dataset**: Enable users to export datasets.
- [ ] **Export Report**: Enable users to generate and export reports summarising the results.
- [ ] **Energy Calculations**: Improve the accuracy and detail of energy modelling and simulation.
- [ ] **CMS**: Include a dashboard to allow the administrator to manage content.
- [ ] **Backend API for Dataset**:Integrate a backend API to store the datasets.
- [ ] **How to Use**: Draft a how to use section in the README.
